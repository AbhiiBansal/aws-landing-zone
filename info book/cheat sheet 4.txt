AWS IAM, PERMISSIONS, SECURITY, LEAST PRIVILEGE, & ROLES CHEAT SHEET
(Lifetime A-to-Z – 2025 India Market – From Associate to Principal Architect)
Golden Rules (Memorise These – Always Follow)

Least Privilege Principle: Give ONLY the exact permissions needed, nothing more. Always use specific actions/resources, never * (wildcard).
Role-Based Access: Use roles over users – roles are temporary, users are permanent (risky).
Mandatory Side Things: Always enable MFA, logging (CloudTrail), and monitoring (GuardDuty) when creating permissions. Test in Dev first.
Trade-Offs Mindset: Balance security (high risk reduction) vs usability (fast time, low cost). Use 3 options to show thinking.
System Design Match to Needs: For every scenario, match to business (e.g., compliance = high security), traffic (high = scalable roles), budget (low = managed policies).
Every Possible Scenario Approach: Ask 5 questions (business goal, volume, compliance, budget, team skill). Then choose 3 options. Implement in console (visual editor first). Test with aws sts assume-role or policy simulator. Deploy with Terraform/CDK for IaC.

| Create Role for CI/CD (e.g., GitHub) | Access Keys (avoid) | OIDC + Role (one repo) | OIDC + Role + Condition (branch/repo specific) | Cost: Free | Time: 10 min → 1 day | Risk: High → Very Low | Scale: High | For CI/CD in startup: Good. For bank: Best with conditions. Console: IAM → Roles → Create → Web identity → Provider URL: token.actions.githubusercontent.com → Add conditions in visual editor | MFA on root, CloudTrail logging, policy simulator test, Terraform IaC |
| Give Permission to User | Full managed policy (AdministratorAccess) | Custom policy (specific actions) | Permission sets + SCP boundary | Cost: Free | Time: Fast → Medium | Risk: High → Low | Scale: High | For internal admin: Better. For external vendor: Best with boundaries. Console: IAM → Policies → Create → Visual editor → Select service/actions/resources | MFA enforce, access analyzer check, session duration limit (1h), audit logs |
| Cross-Account Access | Manual assume-role URL | OrganizationAccountAccessRole (Control Tower) | Custom role + PrivateLink + Condition keys | Cost: Free | Time: Fast → Medium | Risk: Medium → Low | Scale: High | For shared services: Better. For compliance: Best with conditions. Console: IAM → Roles → Create → AWS account → Another AWS account → Enter account ID | CloudTrail org-wide, GuardDuty, Config rules for compliance, test assume-role CLI |
| API Permission Control | Inline policy on Lambda | Managed policy + Condition (e.g., IP) | Boundary policy + Session policies | Cost: Free | Time: Fast → Medium | Risk: Medium → Low | Scale: High | For public API: Good. For secure bank API: Best with boundaries. Console: IAM → Policies → Create → Visual editor → Add conditions | WAF integration, API Gateway authorizer, access logs, rate limiting |
| Secrets Access | Parameter Store basic access | Secrets Manager + role-based | Secrets Manager + KMS + rotation | Cost: Free → $0.40/secret | Time: Fast → Medium | Risk: Medium → Low | Scale: High | For startup: Good. For RBI: Best with rotation. Console: IAM → Policies → Create → SecretsManager actions + KMS decrypt | Rotation enabled, KMS customer key, CloudTrail + GuardDuty for monitoring, no hardcode |

(Lifetime A-to-Z – 2025 India Market – From Associate to Principal Architect)
Golden Rules (Memorise These – Always Follow)

Match to Needs: Ask 5 golden questions (business goal, volume, compliance, budget, timeline) – never design without them.
Security First: Always use private subnets, deny public access, encrypt transit.
Trade-Off Mindset: Balance cost (low = VPC Peering), time (fast = default VPC), risk (low = Transit Gateway), scalability (high = Global Accelerator).
Test & Monitor: Use VPC Flow Logs + Reachability Analyzer for everything.
Every Possible Scenario Approach: Ask questions → 3 options → explain trade-offs → recommend based on compliance (e.g., RBI = private only). Implement in console (visual editor for policies). Test with ping/traceroute. Deploy with Terraform/CDK.
