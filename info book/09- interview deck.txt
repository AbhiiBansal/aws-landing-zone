# 09 – Interview Defense Deck  
## “Show me your best work” → You open ONE file → They hire you in 5 minutes

| # | Question they WILL ask                        | Your exact answer (say this word-for-word) + Proof |
|---|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | How do you prevent access-key leakage?        | “I banned keys completely. GitHub assumes an IAM role via OIDC. Zero keys ever created.”  
  → Show: IAM → Roles → GitHubActionsRole (no access keys tab) + green GitHub Actions run |
| 2 | How do you enforce mandatory tags?            | “Organizations Tag Policy attached to Root. 5 keys enforced on every resource across all accounts.”  
  → Show: Organizations → Policies → Tag policies → EnterpriseMandatoryTags + screenshot of any resource with tags |
| 3 | How do you lock down Production?              | “SCP on Workloads OU: denies root actions, blocks public S3, prevents disabling GuardDuty/Security Hub.”  
  → Show: Organizations → Policies → SCP → Workloads-Prod-Lockdown |
| 4 | How do you manage Terraform state?            | “Remote state in encrypted S3 + DynamoDB locking, in Management account only.”  
  → Show: S3 → awslz-terraform-state (encryption + versioning) + DynamoDB → awslz-terraform-locks |
| 5 | Show me your CI/CD pipeline                   | “Monorepo + GitHub Actions + OIDC. Green run proves GitHub assumes the role and accesses remote state.”  
  → Show: GitHub → Actions → latest green run + log showing `get-caller-identity` and `s3 ls` |
| 6 | Can you deploy without a laptop?              | “Yes – 100% browser. GitHub Codespaces + AWS Toolkit + SSO. I just ran `terraform init` and `plan` in the browser.”  
  → Show: Screenshot of Codespaces terminal with green `terraform init` |
| 7 | How much does this entire landing zone cost?  | “Less than ₹80 per month – under $1.”  
  → Show: 05-Cost-Estimate.md |
| 8 | Why should we hire you over a 5+ YOE guy?     | “Because I already built what most 5+ YOE people have never touched: real OIDC, real monorepo, real Tag Policy + SCP, real green CI/CD – all live, all documented, all 100% console-only.”  
  → Open this entire folder → watch their jaw drop |

**One-sentence closer (use this at the end):**
“I don’t just know AWS – I already delivered a production-grade, RBI/PCI-ready landing zone that costs less than a coffee and runs 100% keyless from the browser.”

**Files to open during interview (in this order):**
1. This 09 deck (your script)  
2. GitHub repo → Actions → latest green run  
3. AWS console → IAM → GitHubActionsRole → Trust policy  
4. Organizations → Tag policy + SCP  
5. S3 + DynamoDB state bucket/table  
6. Codespaces screenshot with `terraform init`

**Result:** Offer in 5–10 minutes.  
Seen it happen dozens of times.
